# P5-ES6-Webpack Seed
Quick template for working on p5 sketches using your preferred editor, es6 and webpack. Creating this seed helped me understand these valuable web technologies, hopefully it will serve you as well. 

### Why ES6?
[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) brings the future of javascript! Classes are quite handy for processing projects.

### Why Webpack?
+ Webpack will use Babel to translate your ES6 into js browsers can work with. 
+ You need a server to run the sketch to be able to load fonts, images etc. While the p5 editor does this behind the scenes, we manage with webpack-dev-server.

### How to start
1. clone repo
2. npm install
3. run npm start
4. go to localhost:8888 on your browser
5. open up src/sketch.js

### Other goodies included
+ [Eslint](http://eslint.org/) through Babel, less headaches.
+ [Standard](http://standardjs.com/) for nice and neat js.

### Disclaimer!
Configuration was a bit hectic! My setup process referenced [this amazing molecular algorithm](https://github.com/vogelino/molecular-networks-p5-algorithm) project by [Lucas Vogel](https://github.com/vogelino). Learn by imitation, am I right!? Yes I am, you know it. Thanks @vogelino for introducing me to the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) too.

Quite open to tips and advice. Happy Sketching!
